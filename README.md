# Lacework-CLI JupyterLab Demo
A basic demo of Lacework CLI commands organized to allow demonstration of CLI capabilities without need to recall command syntax from memory, or copy/paste of commands. Jupyter Lab allows execution of commands within shell with one-handed press of _command-enter._ This enables you to focus on discussion.
